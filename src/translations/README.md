### Contribute Translations

Would you like to see Truck Tools in your language? We are using [Weblate][weblate], an easy-to-use platform that allows anyone to translate this project through a convenient web interface.
Create an account and start proposing text strings that could be added to the application in the future.

Remember, contributing translations makes you a collaborator of the project!

### **Translation Instructions ☕**

Our goal is to support multiple languages, driven by contributions from our community. Please follow these guidelines when participating:

1. **Maintain consistency in style and terminology**: Be sure to use terms consistent with the context of the project.

2. **Avoid literal translations**: Phrases should sound natural in the target language while preserving the original meaning.

3. **Comment on any doubts or ambiguities**: If you find ambiguous or confusing strings, use Weblate’s comment system to request clarification.

4. **Use contextual testing**: Whenever possible, consult the string's context in the application to ensure accurate translation.

5. **Avoid unreviewed machine translations**: While you can use machine translation tools as references, make sure to review them carefully before submitting.

#### **Remember**

- If a language is missing text strings to be translated and is over 50% complete, the missing strings will be filled in using the English template. This ensures the application can be uploaded without errors.
- If a language is less than 50% complete, it will not be integrated into the application until it meets the minimum threshold (ideally, translations should always be 100% complete).
