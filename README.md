# Truck Tools

> [!WARNING]
> This application is not yet completely ready so it could have bugs and problems. This is why the updates arrive as a pre-release.

## Download

To download and install the application you will first need to download the latest version at the following link <https://github.com/CoffeSiberian/truck-tools/releases/latest>

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not download this application through third party sites. Use only this repository to download the application so that you avoid at all costs any malicious file.

## Install

To install you will need to run the downloaded file (**.msi**) where it is likely that Windows will run a SmartScreen alert warning that the executable is unknown and will prevent you from installing the application.

> [!NOTE]
> This message appears because the application does not have a digital signature (which usually has to be paid for) so the system does not trust it, but it does not directly mean that it is some kind of malicious file. As long as the file you are downloading is from this repository and not from a third party.
